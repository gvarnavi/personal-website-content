During the course of my PhD, I have developed an open-source software package called [SpaRTaNS](https://narang-lab.github.io/spartans/) to perform spatially-resolved transport by solving the steady-state Boltzmann transport equation in three real-space and three momentum-space dimensions.

SpaRTaNS is "carrier-agnostic", and so far we have used it to investigate [thermal interface resistance of semi-coherent interfaces]({{< ref "/publications/phys-rev-b-100-115402-2019" >}}) and the importance of microscopic interactions in electron hydrodynamic flows.
