I spend a great deal of my time thinking about pedagogy and the role visualization and computation can play in education.
Currently, I am co-authoring an open-source materials science textbook with long-time friend and mentor [Prof. W. Craig Carter](https://dmse.mit.edu/people/w-craig-carter).
The idea is to curate some of the content we've developed teaching through the years, into a cohesive collection of computational notebooks which would guide undergraduate and first-year graduate students in materials science and engineering programs.

An example such computational essay on the Lennard-Jones interatomic potential using open-source, client-based, interactive simulations can be found [here](https://observablehq.com/@gvarnavi/teaching-materials-science-concepts-using-the-d3-force).

In the spring of 2022 I was the lead instructor for an MIT-course called _3.029 -- Mathematics and Computational Thinking for Materials Scientists and Engineers I_ where we piloted some of this content to sophomores learning thermodynamics and polymer synthesis.
The resulting notebooks are freely-available on the [class website](https://dmse-mit.github.io/3029/).

More recently, together with editor-in-chief [Dr. Colin Ophus](https://foundry.lbl.gov/about/staff/colin-ophus/) and the developers at the [Curvenote](https://curvenote.com/) writing platform, I have been developing and editing content for a new interactive journal called [Elemental Microscopy](https://www.elementalmicroscopy.com), which aims to publish focused reviews and tutorials of foundational concepts in microscopy in a dynamic multi-media digital format.
