I spend some of my time thinking about pedagogy and the role visualization and computation can play in education.
Currently, I am co-authoring a materials science textbook with long-time friend and mentor [W. Craig Carter](https://dmse.mit.edu/people/w-craig-carter).
The idea is to use some of the content we've developed teaching through the years, into a cohesive collection of computational notebooks which would guide undergraduate and first-year graduate students in materials science and engineering programs.

An example such computational essay on the Lennard-Jones interatomic potential using open-source, client-based, interactive simulations can be found [here](https://observablehq.com/@gvarnavi/teaching-materials-science-concepts-using-the-d3-force).
