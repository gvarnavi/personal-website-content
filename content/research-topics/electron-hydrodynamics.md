In most conductors at room-temperature, electron collisions are akin to billiard balls, resulting in the macroscopic observation of diffusive flow (Ohm's "law").
Recently, spatially-resolved transport measurements have revealed electrons in strongly-interacting materials can behave akin to classical fluids, confirming theoretical predictions over fifty years old.

I study these "hydrodynamic" electron flows across various length scales, from their microscopic origins, to their macroscopic observables.
I was recently part of a team which [imaged these flows in a 3D conductor for the first time](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2021/09/first-glimpse-hydrodynamic-electron-flow-3d-materials), corroborating a newly-proposed electron interaction mechanism by us mediated by lattice vibrations.
