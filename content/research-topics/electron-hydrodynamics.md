In most conductors at room-temperature, electron collisions are akin to billiard balls, resulting in the macroscopic observation of diffusive flow (Ohm's "law").
Recently, spatially-resolved transport measurements have revealed electrons in strongly-interacting materials can behave akin to classical fluids, confirming theoretical predictions over fifty years old.

I study these "hydrodynamic" electron flows across various length scales, from their microscopic origins, to mesoscopic finite-size effects, and to their macroscopic observables.
Recently, I was part of a team which [imaged these flows in a 3D conductor for the first time](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2021/09/first-glimpse-hydrodynamic-electron-flow-3d-materials), corroborating a newly-proposed electron interaction mechanism mediated by lattice vibrations.

Currently, as a postdoctoral [Miller research fellow](https://miller.berkeley.edu/fellowship/members/current-miller-fellows), I'm developing computational imaging techniques to correlate such non-uniform current densities with the underlying structure, opening the door to investigating the role of structure and defects in designing near-dissipation-less electronics and inviting questions like "does current flow around defects in materials similar to how rivers flow past pebbles? If so, can we engineer them to minimize thermal dissipation?"
