I have always hated making slide decks.
I find them hard to make simple-enough to be readable/elegant, yet detailed-enough to be informative.
After years of fiddling with unsatisfying designs, I settled on a [split-slide format](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bRpFfyZj3zhH5MEPNEHhit0eYasK9CgytosqqYIsv0g/edit?usp=sharing) I was happy with and re-used for a couple of years.
I eventually got tired of it.

Recently, I started using a ReactJS+ObservableHQ+Docusaurus workflow to make interactive presentations which are (relatively) easy to maintain and deploy.
In the spirit of open-source science, this page lists these presentations as-well as a post on some [tips and tricks]({{< ref "/presentations/interactive-presentations-workflow" >}}) to getting started.
