abstract: "Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has been extensively used for imaging complex materials down to atomic resolution. The most commonly employed STEM imaging modality of annular dark field produces easily-interpretable contrast, but is dose-inefficient and produces little to no contrast for light elements and weakly-scattering samples. An alternative is to use phase contrast STEM imaging, enabled by high speed detectors able to record full images of a diffracted STEM probe over a grid of scan positions. Phase contrast imaging in STEM is highly dose-efficient, able to measure the structure of beam-sensitive materials and even biological samples. Here, we comprehensively describe the theoretical background, algorithmic implementation details, and perform both simulated and experimental tests for three iterative phase retrieval STEM methods: focused-probe differential phase contrast, defocused-probe parallax imaging, and a generalized ptychographic gradient descent method implemented in two and three dimensions. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each of these approaches using a consistent framework to allow for easier comparison. This presentation of STEM phase retrieval methods will make these methods more approachable, reproducible and more readily adoptable for many classes of samples."
