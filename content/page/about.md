I'm originally from Cyprus where I grew up and studied before moving to the US to obtain my BS in materials science & engineering and BS in civil & environmental engineering from MIT in 2017.
Enamored with the Boston weather, I decided to stay at MIT to pursue my graduate studies in the department of Materials Science, where I recently defended my thesis entitled "Electron Hydrodynamics in Crystalline Solids".

Currently, I'm a postdoctoral Miller research fellow at the University of California, Berkeley -- co-hosted by Prof. Mary Scott in MSE and Prof. Joel Moore in Physics -- where I'm developing new computational imaging modalities to observe current densities in anisotropic electron fluids with high spatial resolution using a transmission electron microscope.

When I don't have my science cap on, I enjoy camping, teaching generative art, and singing along to musical theater videos.
