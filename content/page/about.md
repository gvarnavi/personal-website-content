After completing my B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering at MIT in 2017, I started my graduate studies in the department of Materials Science at MIT, where I am co-advised by Professors Prineha Narang and Polina Anikeeva.

My research focuses on non-equilibrium transport in interacting condensed matter systems. 
Lately, I've been fascinated by the emergence of electron "hydrodynamic" behavior in ultra-clean (semi-)metals and developing new imaging modalities with which to observe the resulting non-uniform current densities. 

When I'm not drawing funny interaction diagrams, I enjoys camping, teaching generative art, and singing along to musical theater YouTube videos.
