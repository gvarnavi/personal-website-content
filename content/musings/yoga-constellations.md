At its first meeting in 1922, the International Astronomical Union (IAU), officially adopted the list of 88 constellations that we use today.
These include 14 men and women, 9 birds, two insects, 19 land animals, 10 water creatures, two centaurs, one head of hair, a serpent, a dragon, a flying horse, a river and 29 inanimate objects. 
As many of us have (frustratingly) witnessed first hand while star-gazing - most of these bear little resemblance to their supposed figures. 
Instead, it is more likely that the ancient constellation-makers meant them to be symbolic, a kind of celestial "Hall of Fame" for their favorite animals or heroes.

This begs two questions I sought to answer with this old [post of mine on Wolfram Community](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1207400):

1. Can we 'do better' now with Wolfram Language's `StarData[]` curated data and Machine Learning functionality?
2. What if the ancient constellation-makers were slightly more creative? 
Say they looked up at the sky, and only saw yoga-poses!
