Together with some friends in the DMSE department, I've been teaching a generative art workshop during MIT's Independent Activity Period (IAP) for the past 5 years.
IAP 2022 was the fifth\* iteration of the workshop (previously taught in 2017 and 2018 with Emma Vargo, 2020 with Amina Matt, Jovana and Nina Andrejevic, and 2021 with Jovana and Nina).

The 4-day workshop walks through python and Wolfram Language notebooks, covering the following broad topics:  
- Geometric Fractals \& L-Systems
- Strange Attractor \& Wallpaper Groups
- Cellular Automata \& Discrete Physical Systems
- Continuous Physical Systems \& Reaction-Diffusion Systems

You can find the most recent notebooks on the [2022 workshop website](https://gvarnavides.com/generative-art-workshop-website/), as well as peruse the [2020](https://github.com/gvarnavi/generative-art-iap/tree/IAP-2020/Gallery)  and [2022](https://gvarnavides.com/generative-art-workshop-website/showcase) workshop galleries.

\* All instructors have recently graduated from MIT. If you're an MIT-affiliate and interested in teaching this in IAP 2023, please reach out -- we will be happy to help and share our notebooks/experience.
